=Delta calibrator
This program automatically calibrates delta 3d printer with Marlin RC7 firmware.

Initial settings are loaded from the printer and new values are automatically written back.

Implementation of parameters calculator was taken from https://github.com/payala/DeltaTuner

Now the program is quite dirty and doesn't has any parameters.
Printrun (https://github.com/kliment/Printrun) is required
