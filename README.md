#Delta calibrator

This program automatically calibrates delta 3d printer running Marlin RC7
firmware with custom addition (https://github.com/nzinov/Marlin/tree/RCBugFix).

Initial settings are automatically loaded from the printer and new values are written back.

Implementation of parameters calculator has been taken from https://github.com/payala/DeltaTuner

Now the program is quite dirty and doesn't have any parameters.

Printrun (https://github.com/kliment/Printrun) is required
